We, humans, are fascinating creatures. When focussed on the right things we can achieve extraordinary things like putting a person on the moon, making silicon chips from sand, cure thousands of diseases and make ungodly technological advances. The key phrase here is "focus". Humans always had a distraction in various forms but with the advent of Smartphones and the internet, it has gone to a whole new level.


All of us are aware of the increasingly negative effects of social media platforms. Somehow the platforms that started to connect us all have become toxic places filled with lies and deception, without human emotions and connections lacking meaningful relationships.

I have realized this for quite some time that social media affects my productivity. Therefore,
* back in March 2021, I shut down all social media on weekends and from 7 PM - 10 AM on weekdays. The idea was to use social media only when I will be anticipating work and not when I am free. It worked! I was able to complete so many things, made significant progress on a whitepaper, and learned so many things.


* Since then I have tried to replicate the same levels of productivity I had back in March during my social media hibernation period but it hasn't been possible. That 5 mins Instagram break turns to 30 mins without me realizing or that 1 video on YouTube becomes 10 videos and then things keep piling up in the backlog. *This has to stop.*


*I have always believed, **"Learning is life"**. The day you stop learning is the day you die. While I have not stopped learning new things, the efficiency has suffered significantly. Therefore I have decided to put an end to this endless waste of precious time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/sir-ray-avery-nz-makes-you-dangerous/">Here's</a> a great article I read many years ago that made me super conscious of our limited time.*

 I have been able to build the habit slowly by using "Digital Wellbeing" <a href="https://wellbeing.google">**(Link)**</a> and limiting Facebook and Instagram to 30 Mins a day and WhatsApp to 1Hr a day (Since WhatsApp also is part of some work activity). Now, I'm ready to completely phase out Facebook and Instagram.


I think WhatsApp is enough to keep in touch with people who matter and that's what I am going to do. There is no need for toxic social media platforms where the worst kind of feelings like anxiety, self-doubt, and false pride are triggered.

**Friend and free? We don't need Facebook, Let's talk!**
