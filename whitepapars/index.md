I'm fascinated by the pace at which technology is progressing. Open Source and the selfless contribution of many people are pushing it even further. Whitepapers are a great way to start an idea that might help solve a bigger problem. Unfortunately, I can't publish my work-related papers here. Therefore it's only a single paper related to the transformation of healthcare.
