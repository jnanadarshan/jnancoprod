Hey there, my name is Jnanadarshan Nayak (Pronounced as Gyana-darshan). I work as a Business Consultant working for the world's most valued IT Services Company - TATA Consultancy Service (TCS). I look after Semiconductors and Consumer Devices Manufacturing strategy, growth, and capability development at my organization. This website is meant to put out random thoughts in a more professional manner for a knowledgeable audience. 

I love learning new things, reading, gardening, and building stuff in my free time.
